# Differences Between Python 2 and Python 3
                by parag 

Python 2 and Python 3 are different versions of Python. Python 3 is the latest and recommended version. Here’s a simple comparison:

---

## 1. Print Statement
- **Python 2:** `print "Hello"`  
- **Python 3:** `print("Hello")`

---

## 2. Integer Division
- **Python 2:** `/` does integer division if both numbers are integers  
  ```python
  5 / 2  # Output: 2
Python 3: / always gives float, // for integer division

python
Copy code
5 / 2   # Output: 2.5
5 // 2  # Output: 2
3. Strings
Python 2: Strings are bytes by default

Python 3: Strings are Unicode by default, bytes handled separately

Example:

python
Copy code
# Python 3
b = b"Hello"  # bytes
s = "Hello"   # Unicode
4. Integer Types
Python 2: int and long

Python 3: Only int (automatically handles big numbers)

5. Libraries
Python 2: Some old libraries may only work here

Python 3: Supports latest libraries and updates

6. Error Handling
Python 2: except Exception, e:

Python 3: except Exception as e:

Summary Table
Feature	Python 2	Python 3
Print	print "Hello"	print("Hello")
Division	/ integer by default	/ float, // integer
Strings	Bytes by default	Unicode by default
Integers	int & long	Only int
Exception	except Exception, e:	except Exception as e:

Conclusion:
Python 3 is modern, consistent, and recommended for new projects. Python 2 is outdated and not maintained anymore
