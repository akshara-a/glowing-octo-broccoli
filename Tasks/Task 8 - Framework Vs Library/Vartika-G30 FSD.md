# Framework vs Library

## What is a Library?

A library is a collection of ready-made code that helps developers complete specific tasks easily and efficiently.

When you use a library:
- You decide when to use it  
- You decide how to use it  
- The control of the application flow remains in your hands  

A library does not force any fixed structure on your project. You simply import it and use its functions wherever they are needed in your code.

**Examples of libraries:**
- React  
- jQuery  
- Lodash  

**In simple words:** you call the library whenever you need it.


## What is a Framework?

A framework is a complete platform that provides a fixed structure for building applications.

When working with a framework:
- The framework controls the flow of the application  
- Developers must follow its rules and conventions  
- It decides where the code should be written and how it should be organized  

A framework offers a standard way of development, which helps keep large projects organized and consistent.

**Examples of frameworks:**
- Angular  
- Django  
- Spring Boot  

**In simple terms:** the framework calls your code.



## Key Differences Between Framework and Library

| Feature        | Library                         | Framework                         |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Control Flow  | Controlled by the developer      | Controlled by the framework       |
| Structure     | No fixed structure               | Predefined structure              |
| Flexibility   | More flexible                    | Less flexible                     |
| Usage         | Used only when needed            | Must follow framework rules       |



## Why Bootstrap is a Framework

Bootstrap is called a front-end framework because it provides a complete system for building responsive and consistent user interfaces.

Bootstrap is not just a set of CSS files. It clearly defines how the user interface should be structured, styled, and behave.

**Reasons why Bootstrap is considered a framework:**

### Predefined Grid System
Bootstrap provides a fixed layout system using containers, rows, and columns that developers must follow.

### Ready-made UI Components
It includes commonly used components such as buttons, navbars, cards, modals, forms, and alerts.

### Rules and Conventions
Developers need to use specific class names like `container`, `row`, `col`, and `btn` for components to work correctly.

### Responsive Design Handling
Bootstrap controls how the UI adapts to different screen sizes using predefined breakpoints.

### Consistent UI Across Devices
It ensures the same look and behavior across different browsers and devices.

Because Bootstrap provides structure, layout rules, reusable components, and responsive behavior, it is classified as a framework, not just a library.



## Conclusion

- A library offers reusable tools and gives more control to the developer  
- A framework provides a structured way of development and controls the application flow  
- Bootstrap is a framework because it defines the structure, design, and responsiveness of the user interface
