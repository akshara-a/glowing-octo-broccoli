# Framework and Library Explaination

## What is a Library?
A **library** is a collection of pre-written code (functions, classes, or methods) that helps developers perform specific tasks easily.  
The main control of the application remains with the developer. You decide **when, where, and how** to use the library in your code.

### Key Points of Library
- Developer controls the program flow
- Used for specific functionality
- Easy to integrate
- Flexible to use

### Examples of Libraries
- **jQuery** – simplifies JavaScript DOM manipulation
- **NumPy** – used for numerical computing in Python
- **React** – used to build UI components

## What is a Framework?
A **framework** is a complete platform that provides a structured way to build applications.  
It defines rules, architecture, and flow of the program. The framework calls your code when needed, not the other way around.  
This concept is known as **Inversion of Control**.

### Key Points of Framework
- Framework controls the flow of the application
- Provides predefined structure and guidelines
- Faster development for large applications
- Less flexibility but more consistency

### Examples of Frameworks
- **Django** – Python web framework
- **Spring** – Java enterprise framework
- **Angular** – frontend framework

## Difference Between Framework and Library

| Aspect | Library | Framework |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Control | Developer controls the flow | Framework controls the flow |
| Usage | Called when needed | Calls developer code |
| Structure | No fixed structure | Fixed architecture |
| Flexibility | High | Limited |
| Scope | Specific functionality | Complete application solution |

**In short:**  
- **Library:** You call the code  
- **Framework:** The code calls you  

## Why is Bootstrap a Framework?
**Bootstrap** is considered a **frontend framework** because it provides a complete structure for designing web pages.

### Reasons Bootstrap is a Framework
- Provides predefined **CSS classes**, **grid system**, and **components**
- Enforces a consistent design structure
- Controls layout and responsiveness
- Includes JavaScript components like modals, navbars, and carousels
- Follows a standard way of building responsive websites

Unlike a simple CSS library, Bootstrap gives a **full design framework** that guides how UI should be built.

### Example
Using Bootstrap, developers follow its grid system and components instead of designing everything from scratch, which makes development faster and consistent.

## Conclusion
- A **library** helps you with specific tasks
- A **framework** provides a complete structure
- Bootstrap is a framework because it offers a full UI design system, layout rules, and reusable components
