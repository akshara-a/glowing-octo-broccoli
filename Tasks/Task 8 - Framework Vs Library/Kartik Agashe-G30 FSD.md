# What Is a Framework?

A **framework** gives us a proper structure to build an application.  
It tells us **how things should be done**.

In a framework, **the framework controls the flow** of the application.

## My Understanding

- Framework decides the structure  
- I write my code inside its rules  
- It controls how my app works  
- Less freedom, but more discipline

## Why I Think Bootstrap Is a Framework

Many people think Bootstrap is just CSS, but after using it, I realized it behaves like a **framework**.

---

## It Forces a Structure

Bootstrap has its own layout system such as:
- `container`
- `row`
- `columns`

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">Left</div>
    <div class="col-6">Right</div>
  </div>
</div>

## Bootstrap Decides the Design

Bootstrap already decides many design things like:
- Button styles  
- Colors  
- Spacing  
- Responsive behavior  

I just use Bootstrap classes instead of writing everything from scratch.

##  Ready-Made Components

Bootstrap provides many built-in components such as:
- Buttons  
- Navbar  
- Forms  
- Modals  
- Alerts  

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>

## Why Bootstrap Is Not Just a Library

- It controls the overall UI structure  
- It applies design rules automatically  
- It affects the entire project  
- We adapt to Bootstrap, not the opposite  

---

## What I Learned

- A library helps when I ask for help  
- A framework tells me how to build things  
- Bootstrap is more than just CSS  
- Frameworks reduce mistakes by giving structure
