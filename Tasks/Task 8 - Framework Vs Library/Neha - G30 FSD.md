Difference between Library and Framework

A library is a collection of pre-written code that helps developers perform specific tasks. In a library, the developer has full control over the flow of the program. The developer decides when and where to use the library functions. For example, when using a math library, the programmer explicitly calls a function like sqrt() whenever it is needed. Libraries are usually focused on solving a particular problem and are more flexible and easy to use.

A framework, on the other hand, provides a complete structure for developing an application. In a framework, the control flow is managed by the framework itself, not the developer. This concept is known as Inversion of Control (IoC). The developer writes code by following the rules and structure defined by the framework, and the framework decides when to call the developer’s code. Frameworks are generally used to build full applications and offer predefined patterns, making development faster but less flexible compared to libraries.

In simple words, when you use a library, you call the code, but when you use a framework, the code calls you.
