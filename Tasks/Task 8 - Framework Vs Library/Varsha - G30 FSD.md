# Library and Framework

## Library – You Are the Boss

A **library** is a helper collection of code that supports your program when you ask for it.

- Your program decides what happens next  
- You import the library only to solve a particular problem  
- It does not force any rules on your project structure  

**In short:** your code calls the library, not the other way around.

### Common Library Examples
- React  
- jQuery  
- NumPy

## Framework – The System Leads You

A **framework** provides an overall system to develop an application. It already decides how things should be organized.

- Your code runs according to the framework’s lifecycle  
- It tells you where to write what  
- You must follow its pattern to make things work  

**In short:** the framework calls your code.

### Common Framework Examples
- Angular  
- Django  
- Bootstrap

## Why Bootstrap Falls Under Framework Category

Bootstrap is not just a style sheet; it gives a **full front-end system** to build web pages.

### Reason 1: Layout Rules Are Already Set
Bootstrap defines how rows, columns, and spacing should work across devices.

### Reason 2: Ready UI Building Blocks
Instead of designing UI from scratch, Bootstrap provides pre-built elements that can be directly used.

### Reason 3: Same Look Everywhere
Bootstrap ensures the website looks consistent on different browsers and screen sizes.

### Reason 4: Mobile Comes First
Bootstrap is designed to work on small screens first and then scale up.
