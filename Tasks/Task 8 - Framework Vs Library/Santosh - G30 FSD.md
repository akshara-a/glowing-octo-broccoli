# Framework vs Library

## Introduction
In software development, **frameworks** and **libraries** help developers build applications faster and more efficiently. Although they are often used together, they are not the same. This document explains the key differences between a framework and a library in a simple way.


## What is a Library?
A **library** is a collection of reusable functions or code that a developer can call whenever needed.  
The developer controls the flow of the program and decides **when and how** to use the library.

### Examples of Libraries
- React
- jQuery
- NumPy
- Lodash

### Key Points
- You call the library
- You control the program flow
- Easy to integrate
- Flexible to use


## What is a Framework?
A **framework** is a complete structure for building an application.  
It provides predefined rules and architecture, and **it calls your code** when needed.

### Examples of Frameworks
- Angular
- Django
- Spring Boot
- Laravel

### Key Points
- Framework controls the flow
- You follow its rules and structure
- Less flexibility than libraries
- Faster for large applications


## Main Difference (Inversion of Control)
The main difference is **control**:

- **Library** → *You control the flow*
- **Framework** → *Framework controls the flow*

## Comparison Table

| Feature        | Library                     | Framework                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Control       | Developer controls flow     | Framework controls flow    |
| Flexibility   | More flexible               | Less flexible              |
| Usage         | Used when needed            | Application is built inside it |
| Structure     | No strict structure         | Follows fixed structure    |
| Learning      | Easier to learn             | Takes more time to learn   |


## Real-Life Example
- **Library** is like a **toolbox** — you take only the tools you need.
- **Framework** is like a **building blueprint** — you must follow the design.

## Conclusion
Libraries give more freedom and control to developers, while frameworks provide a complete structure for building applications. Both are important, and choosing between them depends on project requirements.
