### Framework vs. Library 

1. The main difference between the two is Inversion of Control (IoC).
* Library: You are the boss. You control the flow of the application.
* Framework: The Framework is the boss. It controls the flow and calls your code when needed.

2. The Analogy
* Library: It is like a Toolbox. You pick up a hammer or wrench only when you need it.
* Framework: It is like a Car. You get inside and it drives; you just steer and press pedals.

3. What it does?
* Library: Solves one specific problem (like doing math, showing a date).
* Framework: Provides a complete skeleton for the whole app (handles the database, the server and the display all at once).

4. Flexibility 
* Library: High Freedom. You can use a library however you want, anywhere in your code.
* Framework: Low Freedom. You must follow the framework's strict rules and patterns.

5. Making Changes
* Library: Easy to change. If you don't like a library, you can usually swap it for another one easily.
* Framework: Hard to change. Once you build your app on a framework, changing to a different one usually means rewriting the whole app.

6. Starting Up
* Library: You can add a library to an existing project instantly.
* Framework: A framework usually requires you to start a new project from scratch using its specific setup.

7. Code Structure
* Library: It doesn't care how you name your files or organize your folders.
* Framework: It forces you to organize your files and folders in a specific way.

8. Learning Curve
* Library: Easy to learn. You only need to learn the specific function you want to use.
* Framework: Harder to learn. You need to understand how the whole system works before you can build anything.

9. Extensibility
* Library: You combine different libraries together to build what you need.
* Framework: You often use specific "plugins" or "extensions" made just for that framework.

10. Decision Making
* Library: You make the decisions. You choose the architecture and how data flows.
* Framework: The framework made the decisions. It has already decided the architecture for you; you just follow it.

## Popular Examples
*Common Libraries* : React (UI building blocks), Pandas (Data Analysis), Requests (HTTP calls).

*Common Frameworks* : Angular (Full web platform), Django (Full stack Python web), Spring Boot (Java applications).
