# **Framework vs Library**

## **What is a Library?**

A **library** is a collection of reusable functions or components that developers **call whenever needed** to perform specific tasks.

* You are in control of the application flow
* You decide **when and where** to use the library
* It provides **specific functionality**, not the full application structure

### **Examples of Libraries**

* jQuery
* React (often referred to as a library)
* NumPy

---

## **What is a Framework?**

A **framework** is a complete structure that **controls the flow of the application**. Developers write their code **within the framework’s rules and architecture**.

* The framework is in control (**Inversion of Control**)
* It provides a **predefined structure**
* You must follow its conventions

### **Examples of Frameworks**

* Angular
* Django
* Bootstrap

A framework is like a **house blueprint**: you design the rooms, but the structure is already fixed.

## **Framework vs Library (Comparison Table)**

| Feature   | Library                     | Framework                      |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Control   | Developer controls the flow | Framework controls the flow    |
| Usage     | Called when needed          | You work within it             |
| Structure | Flexible                    | Predefined                     |
| Scope     | Specific functionality      | Complete application structure |
| Examples  | React, jQuery               | Angular, Django                |

# **Why Bootstrap is a Framework**

Bootstrap is considered a **front-end framework** because it provides a **complete system** for building responsive and consistent websites.

## **Reasons Why Bootstrap is a Framework**

### **1. Predefined Structure**

Bootstrap provides:

* Grid system
* Layout utilities
* UI components

This offers a **ready-made structure** for UI development.

---

### **2. Built-in Components**

Bootstrap includes ready-to-use components such as:

* Buttons
* Navbars
* Modals
* Cards
* Forms

This reduces the need to build components from scratch.

---

### **3. Consistent Design System**

Bootstrap ensures design consistency using:

* Predefined colors
* Typography styles
* Responsive breakpoints

This maintains a **uniform look and feel** across the application.

---

### **4. Responsive Grid System**

Bootstrap’s grid system:

* Automatically adapts to different screen sizes
* Follows a **mobile-first design approach**

This is a **core feature of a framework**.

---

### **Conclusion**

Bootstrap is classified as a framework because it provides **structure, reusable components, and design guidelines**, enabling faster and consistent front-end development.
